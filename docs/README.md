# Documentation Guidelines

This folder contains app-level documentation such as API integration guides, feature specifications, and architectural overviews.

**Guidelines:**
- **Do NOT** add temporary planning documents (e.g., implementation plans, task checklists) here.
- Use this space for persistent documentation that provides value for understanding the codebase and its features.
- Examples of appropriate documents:
  - API Integration Guides
  - Feature Architecture Specs
  - Design Decisions
  - Microcopy standards (`MicrocopyStyleGuide.md`, `MicrocopyGlossary.md`)
