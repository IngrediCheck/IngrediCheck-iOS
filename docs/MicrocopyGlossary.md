## Canonical terms

### Food Notes (preferred)

- **Use for**: the user’s saved food preferences, avoid lists, dietary notes, and personalization inputs.\n  Examples: “Food Notes”, “Your Food Notes”, “Edit Food Notes”
- **Avoid** using as a verb (“food-note”) or as “foodnote”.

### Preferences

- **Use for**: specific selectable items or the concept of preference sections.\n  Examples: “Taste preferences”, “Your preferences are saved”
- **Do not use for**: the global feature name (prefer “Food Notes”).

### Restrictions

- **Use for**: strict avoid/medical/allergy-driven constraints.\n  Examples: “Dietary restrictions”, “Allergy restrictions”
- **Avoid** using as a catch-all synonym for Food Notes.

### Profile

- **Use for**: a person’s identity in the app (name + avatar) tied to Food Notes.\n  Examples: “Create a profile”, “Meet your profile”
- **Avoid** using “profile” when you mean the family space (that’s IngrediFam).

### Member / People

- **Use for**: individuals inside a family.\n  Prefer “member” in system-y contexts (Manage Family), and “people” in friendly explanatory copy.

### Scan

- **Use for**: the user action and its result.\n  Examples: “Scan a product”, “Recent scans”, “Scan results”
- **Avoid** mixing “check” as a synonym unless it’s part of a defined feature label.

### Sign in / Sign out

- **Use for**: authentication actions.\n  Examples: “Sign in to continue”, “Sign in with Apple”, “Sign out”
- **Avoid** “Sign-in” as a verb label (hyphenated).
- **Avoid** mixing “log in” vs “sign in” across v2.0; prefer “Sign in”.

## Brand terms (canonical spelling)
